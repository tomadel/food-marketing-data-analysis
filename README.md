# Food Marketing Data Analysis Project

This project explores a marketing dataset to uncover customer behavior patterns, campaign acceptance trends, and spending habits. The goal is to provide actionable insights for targeting customers more effectively.

##  Project Overview

Using Python and pandas, the analysis investigates how demographics, product spending, and marketing campaign response vary by:

- Age group
- Family status (kids/no kids)
- Education level
- Marital status
- Marketing channel effectiveness (catalog, store, web)

##  Key Findings

- **Age (30–70)**: This group spends more but is less responsive to campaigns. Still, it's the largest segment.
- **Younger (21–30) and Older (70+) users**: More likely to accept marketing campaigns.
- **Catalog marketing** has the highest campaign acceptance rate.
- **No Kids** households are higher spenders.
- **Education** had no significant impact on behavior.
- **Marital Status** didn’t strongly influence response or spending, though married/single/together individuals spent slightly more.

##  Recommendations

- **Split campaigns** across catalog (40%), store (30%), and web (30%).
- **Target high earners with no kids** using differentiated platform strategies.
- **Focus on new users (21–30, 70+)** to increase campaign acceptance.

##  Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
